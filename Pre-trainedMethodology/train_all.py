Sad:
I woke up with that heavy kind of silence that follows a long cry. The air in my room felt like a weight, and my heart dragged behind me like a chain. I moved through the day like a ghost, surrounded by people yet entirely invisible. Nothing hurt in a sharp way‚Äîit was more like everything was dulled, as if the colors of the world had faded into grayscale. I didn‚Äôt want to talk, not because I was angry, but because I didn‚Äôt think my voice could hold itself together long enough to form words.

Happy:
I danced around the kitchen while making breakfast, half-singing, half-laughing at how silly I must‚Äôve looked. But it didn‚Äôt matter. There was no audience, no performance‚Äîjust joy for the sake of it. Even my coffee tasted better, like it knew I was in a good mood and wanted to contribute. Little things kept adding up like confetti: a kind message from a friend, a sunny window seat, a perfect song at the perfect time.

Love:
I‚Äôve loved before, but never like this. This feels like building a home inside someone‚Äôs soul, and watching them do the same in mine. I want to grow with them, not just through the good‚Äîbut through the messy, raw, real parts of life. And somehow, loving them makes me love myself a little more too.

Angry:
I am not just irritated‚ÄîI am simmering. Beneath every polite nod and forced smile is a scream waiting to be let out. I replay the conversation in my head, over and over, each time catching a new moment where I should‚Äôve said something, where I should‚Äôve stood up, where I let it slide. I hate that I kept quiet. I hate that they think I‚Äôm okay with it.
